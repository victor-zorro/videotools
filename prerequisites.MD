**Before you begin!**

You will need a properly configured computer running Microsoft Windows 10 home or pro 

Also node-red running at boot is recomended.
See https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/windows for instructions.

In node-red make sure at least the following flows installed through manage my palette:

node-red-dashboard

Later on I will also use:

node-red-contrib-osc

node-red-contrib-pjlink
https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-pjlink

node-red-contrib-artnet-node
